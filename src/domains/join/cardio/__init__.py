"""Cardio join helpers

This package contains helpers that merge cardiovascular per-domain artifacts
into the snapshot joined CSV (by `date`).

Default input: cardio artifact dir (e.g. zepp_processed/_latest or per-domain
artifact directories) and snapshot joined CSV.
Default output: merged joined CSV under `joined/joined_features_daily.csv` and
a per-domain `features_cardiovascular.csv`.
