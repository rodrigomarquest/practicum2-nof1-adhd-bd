        Decrypt an iOS encrypted backup using the passphrase chosen in iTunes.

        The passphrase and decryption keys will be stored in memory whilst using this code,
        and a temporary decrypted copy of the Manifest database containing a list of all files
        in the backup will be created in a temporary folder. If run on a machine without full-disk
        encryption, this may leak the keys and reduce the overall security of the backup.
        If an exception occurs during program execution, there is a chance this decrypted Manifest
        database will not be removed. Its location is stored in '_temp_decrypted_manifest_db_path'
        which can be printed and manually inspected if desired.

              - '%UserProfile%\\Apple\\MobileSync\\Backup\\[device-specific-hash]'

            single output_folder, which may not preserve duplicate matched filenames.

            If True, extracted files will be split into domain subfolders inside output_folder. This can be useful when
            extracting multiple domains which may have files with identical internal iOS filenames.

            When True, if the file already exists in the output folder it will only be overwritten if the iOS
            last modification time is after the local filesystem modification time. This may avoid unnecessary
            disk IO and computation to decrypt the files.
            Note that if files in the output folder are modified after extraction, it may prevent 'newer' versions
            being extracted from the backup!
            If False or not provided, files are always written to disk, overwriting any existing files.
        :param filter_callback
            Optional. If it is provided this function will be called before each matching file is decrypted, with
            metadata about the file. If it returns True, the file will be decrypted; if it returns a false-y value,
            the file will be skipped. Note that the filtering this callback enables is performed before any
            filtering caused by the 'incremental' argument and does not override that.
            This can be used to perform more complex file extraction than wildcard matching by relativePath and domain.
            The callback can also be used to deduce progress information, since the function is provided with
            data about the index of the current file and the total number of matched files.
            An example including the callback function signature (including '**kwargs' is strongly recommended for
            forwards-compatibility):

                def f(*, n, total_files, relative_path, domain, file_id, **kwargs):

        :return: number of files extracted.
            If this number does not match the number of files created on disk, then some duplicate filenames may have
            been overwritten. If 'incremental' enabled and some files already existed in the output folder,
            the number returned will be the number of files modified or created, excluding those skipped because they
            had not changed since the last extraction.
