# Copilot & AI-assisted docs

This folder contains session logs, completion reports, and technical notes
generated with the help of GitHub Copilot / Claude / ChatGPT.

They are kept here for transparency and provenance, but they are **not**
considered canonical design documents. For the main pipeline architecture and
research-facing documentation, start from:

- `docs/ETL_ARCHITECTURE_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/ETL_EDA_MODELING_PLAN.md`
- `pipeline_overview.md`
