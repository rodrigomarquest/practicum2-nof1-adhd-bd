## [v4.1.1] – 2025-11-07

### Infrastructure Improvements & CI/Batch Support

**Summary:**  
Hotfix release addressing tqdm progress bar visibility in Git Bash/MSYS2 terminals and adding non-interactive Python EDA script for CI/batch pipelines. Enables fully automated workflows without notebook kernel dependency.

**Key improvements:**

- tqdm progress bars now visible in Git Bash despite isatty() detection quirks
- Non-interactive NB1 EDA script: NB1_EDA_daily.py for CI/GitHub Actions
- Makefile targets for complete pipeline orchestration with EDA
- Full cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS)

### Added

- **NB1_EDA_daily.py:** Non-interactive Python version of NB1_EDA_daily.ipynb

  - Generates nb1_eda_summary.md, nb1_feature_stats.csv, nb1_manifest.json
  - Saves 5+ PNG visualizations (coverage, signals, correlations, labels)
  - CLI args: --pid, --snapshot, --repo-root
  - Logging with INFO messages, no user interaction
  - Useful for CI pipelines, GitHub Actions, batch processing

- **Makefile targets for EDA automation:**

  - `make nb1-eda-run`: Execute NB1_EDA_daily.py with ETL_TQDM=1
  - `make full-with-eda`: Complete pipeline (extract→join→enrich→nb1-eda)

- **tqdm Git Bash/MSYS2 detection:**

  - Improved \_should_show_tqdm() with MSYSTEM/TERM environment detection
  - Fallback detection for interactive terminals where isatty() fails
  - Environment variable control: ETL_TQDM=1 (force), ETL_TQDM=0 (disable)

- **ZIP extraction progress bars:**
  - Added progress_bar during Apple Health ZIP extraction
  - Added progress_bar during Zepp AES-encrypted ZIP extraction
  - File-level feedback prevents user perception of hang during long extractions
  - Shows real-time progress for potentially 1000s of files

### Changed

- `.gitignore`: Whitelist notebooks/\*.py for EDA/modeling scripts
- `.gitignore`: Add reports/ and latest/ to outputs exclusion list
- Progress bar display logic: Now respects Git Bash/MSYS2 terminals
- **Makefile default behavior:** ETL_TQDM now defaults to 1 (progress bars enabled by default)
  - Users can override with `make <target> ETL_TQDM=0` to disable progress bars if needed
  - Ensures full pipeline visibility and user feedback without explicit flags

### Fixed

- tqdm progress bars not displaying in Git Bash terminal despite interactive TTY
- NB1 EDA output organization (reports/ + latest/ mirror)
- **Makefile Python unbuffered output:** Added `-u` flag to all Python commands to ensure real-time progress bar visibility during long-running ETL extractions (extract runs for ~10 min)
- **CDA export_cda.xml parser memory overflow:** Replaced whole-file parsing with streaming iterparse() for large files (4GB+)
  - Now uses memory-efficient chunk-based streaming (1MB chunks, 500MB limit)
  - Automatic fallback chain: strict parse → lxml.iterparse → recover mode → salvage streaming
  - Prevents OutOfMemory errors during Apple Health CDA extraction
  - **Progress bar with total estimation:** Added record count estimation for progress feedback
    - Fast binary scan of file for `<entry` and `<Section` tags
    - Progress shows percentage/ETA instead of just items/sec
    - Prevents CLI from appearing hung during CDA parsing

### Breaking Changes

- ⚠️ **Hard-removed CUTOVER/TZ functionality:** ETL now operates UTC-only for all timestamps and daily binning
  - Removed `--cutover`, `--tz-before`, `--tz-after` CLI flags entirely
  - Removed `make_tz_selector()` and all timezone-switching logic
  - All timestamps are parsed/converted to UTC; daily buckets use UTC midnight
  - Impact: All `features_*.csv` files now use UTC date columns; no local timezone projection
  - Migration: If local day views needed for reporting, compute downstream (e.g., `df['date_local'] = df['timestamp_utc'].dt.tz_convert('Europe/Dublin').dt.floor('D')`)
  - **Rationale:** Simplified timezone handling reduces off-by-one errors in multi-device scenarios with DST transitions

### Infrastructure

- CI-ready NB1 EDA with no notebook kernel dependency
- Progress visualization works across Windows/Git Bash/Linux
- Batch processing support via CLI entry points

### Tested

- NB1_EDA_daily.py: <10s execution on test data (201 rows × 53 cols)
- 5 PNG plots + JSON metadata generated successfully
- ETL_TQDM=1 enables progress bars in Git Bash
- All outputs UTF-8 encoded (cross-platform compatible)

## [v4.1.0] – 2025-11-07

### Fase 3 ETL Consolidation & Production-Ready Analytics

**Summary:**  
Major consolidation milestone completing Fase 3 of the ETL→Modeling pipeline with production-ready analytics, unified extract infrastructure for Apple/Zepp variants, and deterministic CLI entrypoints for cardio/sleep/activity domain seeds.

**Key achievements:**

- End-to-end reproducibility from raw device exports → normalized domain datasets → feature engineering.
- Resolves 4 critical data quality issues (#8, #9, #10, #13).
- Manifest-based provenance with full audit trail.

### Added

- **Unified Extract Orchestration:** Single discovery pipeline for Apple Health export, iTunes backup, AutoExport, and Zepp imports.
- **Snapshot Path Normalization:** Canonical path `data/etl/<PID>/<YYYY-MM-DD>/` (removed redundant `snapshots/` nesting).
- **CLI Domain Entrypoints:** `etl_runner activity`, `etl_runner cardio`, `etl_runner sleep` with dry-run support.
- **Fase 3 Analytics Pipeline:** Per-domain joins (cardio HR/HRV, activity steps, sleep intervals) with post-join enrichments.
- **NB1_EDA_MIGRATION.md:** Consolidation report documenting Fase 1→3 analytics workflow and migration guides.
- **Manifest-Based Provenance:** All extract stages log source file, size, modification timestamp with validation warnings.
- **Optional Progress Visualization:** `ETL_TQDM=1` enables tqdm bars for large files.

### Fixed

- Corrected PID extraction from snapshot directory (cardio outputs now write to `data/etl/<PID>/<SNAP>/joined/`).
- Fixed activity import to discover Apple export.xml under extracted structure with fallback to daily CSVs.
- Harmonized CLI dry-run exit codes: dry-run=0, empty real run=2.
- Fixed cross-platform shell compatibility in ETL namespace Makefile recipes.
- Removed deprecated standalone cardio orchestrator (integrated into full ETL).

### Changed

- ETL namespace now unified under `make etl` orchestrator with subcommands.
- Normalized line endings (LF) across Makefile and CLI entrypoints.
- Activity import now supports home timezone profile for multi-device scenarios.
- Improved Windows/Git Bash/Linux compatibility.

### Infrastructure

- Extended Makefile modernization with modular ETL orchestration.
- Cross-platform testing validated on Windows (bash.exe) and Linux.
- Dry-run mode tested; idempotence checks pass for re-runs.

### Documentation

- Release notes follow academic template with citation and reproducibility guarantees.
- Updated README and DEV_GUIDE with new CLI entrypoints and Fase 3 workflow.

### Issues Resolved

- Closes #8 (Remove Deprecated Cardio ETL step)
- Closes #9 (Incorrect data_etl participant snapshots directory)
- Closes #10 (ETL: cardio outputs written to wrong path)
- Closes #13 (Snapshot date incoherence across sources)

## 🔧 Summary

Release 2.1.7

This release strengthens the end-to-end reproducibility and auditability of the N-of-1 ETL → Modeling pipeline.  
All new scripts follow the **atomic write**, **manifest-based provenance**, and **idempotent rerun** guarantees.

Author: Rodrigo Marques Teixeira
Project: MSc AI for Business – Practicum Part 2 (N-of-1 ADHD + BD)
Previous: v2.1.1 – Cardio Stabilization & EDA Path Fix

🔧 Summary

This release freezes the environment for the first Kaggle baseline modelling preview and performs a safe repository hygiene pass.
It ensures that only relevant source files, notebooks, and documentation are tracked, while sensitive or large data directories (data_ai/, data_etl/) remain strictly local.

A clean tag (v2.1.3) marks the final pre-modelling checkpoint, establishing a reproducible, compliant foundation for feature consolidation and predictive analysis.

🧩 Highlights
🧹 Repository Hygiene

Removed transient and system-specific directories: .venv/, **pycache**/, .pytest_cache/, and Jupyter checkpoints.

Deleted obsolete decrypted outputs (decrypted*output*\*) — ETL and wearable data preserved.

Cleaned temporary .bak, .fixbak, and .pre\_\* artifacts from prior ETL iterations.

Added .gitattributes for export-ignore, enabling clean archive generation.

🛡️ Data Protection & .gitignore

Confirmed that no PII or wearable data is versioned.

Duplicated .continue/ rules simplified for clarity.

Retained .keep sentinels in data_ai/ and data_etl/ for structural integrity.

📓 Baseline Notebook Integration

Added baseline notebooks (practicum-ca2-final.ipynb, etc.) for early Kaggle environment validation.

Ensured offline-safe artifact saving to notebooks/eda_outputs/ (ignored by VCS).

Normalized Makefile for cross-platform compatibility (Windows ↔ Kaggle ↔ Linux).

⚙️ Build & Tagging

Explicit tag-based release process (v2.1.3) replacing previous multi-tag confusion.

Safe selective staging (git add pathspec) to prevent accidental inclusion of local datasets.

🧠 Next Steps

Merge chore/repo-hygiene → main (complete).

Extend ETL with:

Consolidated features_daily_updated.csv (sleep/cardio/activity/screentime).

state_of_mind.csv label integration (features_daily_labeled.csv).

QC reporting (etl_qc_summary.csv, etl_report.md).

Start 04_modeling_baseline.ipynb for cross-validation and metrics export.

Prepare updated Feature Catalogue and appendices for Practicum CA3.

## [v2.0.3] – 2025-10-17

### 🔧 Dependency & Build Standardization

**Summary:**  
This version consolidates all dependency management into a unified and modular structure, adds precise Makefile targets for each environment, and ensures compatibility across Python 3.10 → 3.13 (Windows + Kaggle GPU).

### Added

- **New dependency structure:**
  - `requirements_etl.txt` – Core ETL pipeline (Py 3.13 safe)
  - `requirements_ios.txt` – iOS backup decryption / Screen Time extraction
  - `requirements_ai_kaggle.txt` – Modeling + SHAP explainability (Kaggle GPU)
  - `requirements_dev.txt` – Development / lint / Jupyter utilities
  - Root `requirements.txt` now includes all modular references.
- **Makefile targets:**
  - `install` → ETL-only environment
  - `install-ios` → iOS extraction stack
  - `install-ai` → Kaggle / modeling environment
  - `install-dev` → dev / test environment
  - `install-all` → full installation (aggregated)
- Added clear comments for Python version compatibility and environment isolation.

### Changed

- Replaced old `etl/requirements.txt` include with modular root requirements.
- Refactored `Makefile` to install from root-level requirements and added help docs.
- Updated `.gitignore` to explicitly ignore all decrypted outputs and iOS temp folders.
- Moved ETL-agnostic extraction scripts into `ios_extract/` sub-directory for clarity.

### Fixed

- Compatibility of `iphone-backup-decrypt==0.9.0` with Windows / Python 3.10–3.12.
- Ensured all ETL dependencies compile cleanly on Python 3.13.
- Unified CRLF/LF handling to prevent Git newline warnings on Windows.

### Notes

- Recommended to maintain two venv environments:  
  • `venv-etl` (Python 3.13) for standard ETL/modeling  
  • `venv-ios` (Python 3.10–3.12) for encrypted iOS backup extraction
- This version completes the project structure stabilization phase.  
  Next release (`v2.0.4`) will focus on full Kaggle modeling reproducibility and drift-detection notebooks.

---

## [v2.0.2] – October 2025

**Status:** Structural consolidation complete

### Summary

This release finalises the repository’s folder architecture and naming consistency for the N-of-1 ADHD + BD Practicum Part 2 project.  
All iOS extraction scripts are now fully consolidated under `ios_extract/`, while the global ETL pipeline remains at the project root.

### Added

- Centralised iOS extraction utilities:
  - `ios_extract/decrypt_manifest.py`
  - `ios_extract/export_screentime.py`
  - `ios_extract/extract_deviceactivity.py`
  - `ios_extract/extract_knowledgec.py`
  - `ios_extract/extract_plist_screentime.py`
  - `ios_extract/plist_to_usage.py`
  - `ios_extract/probe_deviceactivity_blobs.py`
  - `ios_extract/quick_post_backup_probe.py`
  - `ios_extract/screentime_ios_backup.py`
  - `ios_extract/smart_extract_plists.py`

### Changed

- Fixed filename typo: `extract_knowledgegc.py` → `extract_knowledgec.py`
- Updated `Makefile` targets to match new script paths
- Improved `.gitignore` with explicit exceptions for `.keep` placeholders  
  and consistent ignoring of decrypted output and manifests

### Removed / Cleaned

- Deleted temporary `manifest_*.tsv` and local generated PDF (`Configuration_Manual_Full.pdf`)
- Removed duplicate `decrypted_output/` under `ios_extract/`
- Eliminated redundant ETL scripts from project root (migrated to `ios_extract/`)

### Notes

- **ETL pipeline:** remains at root (`etl_pipeline.py`)
- **Next milestone:** add `parse_knowledgec_usage.py` once `KnowledgeC.db` schema is confirmed
- Repository is now compliant with the Practicum CA3 submission layout and ready for academic archiving

## [v2.0-pre-ethics] — 2025-10-17

### Added

- **ios_extract/** module:
  - `decrypt_manifest.py` — decrypts Manifest and validates SQLite.
  - `quick_post_backup_probe.py` — probes candidates w/ `flags=1` and on-disk blobs.
  - `smart_extract_plists.py` — adaptive extraction of `DeviceActivity.plist` and `ScreenTimeAgent.plist` (handles API variations in `iphone-backup-decrypt==0.9.0`).
  - `plist_to_usage_csv.py` — heuristics to export daily usage from plists (settings-only snapshots produce empty CSV for provenance).
  - `extract_knowledgec.py` — pulls `KnowledgeC.db` when available.
- **Makefile** with targets: `venv`, `install`, `decrypt`, `probe`, `extract-plists`, `plist-csv`, `extract-knowledgec`, `parse-knowledgec`, `etl`, `clean`, `deepclean`.
- Extended **README.md** documenting iOS extraction workflow and integration with ETL.
- Hardened **.gitignore** to exclude decrypted outputs (`decrypted_output/`, `.plist`, `.db`, `.sqlite*`, etc.) and secrets.

### Changed

- Repository structure updated to include `ios_extract/` and keep PII out of version control.
- ETL docs clarified (segment normalisation S1–S6 and time-zone cutover).

### Security

- Explicit guidance to keep backup passphrases out of code.
- Default `deepclean` target to remove decrypted outputs locally.
